# ramen-ratings-analysis
![IMG](ramen_splash.png)

I love making ramen and also trying new instant ramen so I am excited to share an educational project about ramen. In this project, I collect data from the Ramen Rater, a hard-core ramen review website. This dataset was created from an export of "The Big List" (of reviews), then converted to a CSV format with over 2500 reviews total.

The current Big List with over 3700 reviews is located [here](https://www.theramenrater.com/resources-2/the-list/). Finally, I will conduct my analysis using both Excel and Python.
